My name is Camden Hatley and I am a first year PhD student at the Univeristy of Kansas, working with Dr. Erin Seybold.
My research focuses on the future of water quality in the Kansas River as a response to changes in climate and land use.

Some goals for this class are to:
-Learn how git can help to keep project files organized
-Learn best practices to make code easily accessible to others
-Learn how to quickly and efficiently interact with gitHub (i.e. directly through R)
